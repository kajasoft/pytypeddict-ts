# pytypeddict-ts
### Python TypedDicts to TypeScript translator

Translate Python 3.11 TypedDict defintions into TypeScript type
definitions from the command line.

## Installation

The GHC Haskell compiler is required. To install a compatible version
of Haskell, we suggest you use [ghc-up][1]. 

[1]:https://www.haskell.org/ghcup

```
# install a recent haskell compiler
ghcup install ghc 9.2.5
ghcup install set ghc 9.2.5
cabal update
# install pytypeddict-ts in ~/.cabal/bin
cabal install
```


## Motivation

This project was inspired by [py-ts-interfaces][2], which states the
motivation perfectly:

[2]:https://github.com/Syndallic/py-to-ts-interfaces

> In web applications where Python is used in the backend and
> TypeScript is used in the frontend, it is often the case that the
> client will make calls to the backend to request some data with some
> specific pre-defined "shape".  On the client-side, an `interface`
> for this data is usually defined and if the Python backend authors
> use typechecking, like with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/), the
> project authors may be typing the JSON response values as well.
>
> This results in a duplication of code.  If the shape changes in the
> backend, the related interface must also be reflect its changes in
> the frontend.  At best, this is annoying to maintain.  At worst,
> over time the interfaces may diverge and cause bugs.
>
> This library aims to have a single source of truth that describes
> the shape of the payload between the backend and the frontend.

We created `pytypeddict-ts` to translate Python TypedDicts across the
Python-TypeScript boundary. `py-ts-interfaces` translates Dataclasses
to TypeScript, but not TypedDicts.


## Usage

Basic usage entails a Unix pipeline:

    cat types.py | pytypeddict-ts > types.ts

In practice, we only want to take select TypeDict definitions from our
Python module and translate them into a complete TypeScript module
file. So we write a more elaborate shell script to achieve this, e.g.,


    echo '// This file is generated by pytypeddict-ts'

    sed -n '/^ContentType/ p' ./app/types.py | pytypeddict-ts
    sed -n '/^TimeStamp/ p' ./app/types.py | pytypeddict-ts

    sed -n '/^class ServiceInfo/,/^ *$/ p' ./app/types.py | pytypeddict-ts
    sed -n '/^class TitleDict/,/^ *$/ p' ./app/types.py | pytypeddict-ts

    cat <<END
    export type TitleHit = TitleDict;
    END
